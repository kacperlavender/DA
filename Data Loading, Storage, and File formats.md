Overview of the mechanics of these functions, which are meant to convert text data into a DataFrame. The optional arguments for these functions may fall into a few categories:
Indexing
	Can treat one or more columns as the returned DataFrame, and whether to get column names from the file, arguments you provide, or not at all.
Type inference and data conversion
	Includes the user-defined value conversions and custom list of missing value markers.
Date and time parsing
	Includes a combining capability, including combining date and time information spread over multiple columns into a single column in the result.
Iterating
	Support for iterating over chunks of very large files.
Unclean data issues
	Includes skipping rows or a footer, comments, or other minor things like numeric data with thousands separated by commas
